Truthy statements to build context
> Each Node is meant to hold the smallest amount of data
> The meaning arises is the relational web
> Relation:
>   Relation could be Unidirectional or Bidirectional
>   Relation is a object that the node refers to.
>   If both nodes of relation refer to that relation obj then it is valid. Otherwise the one that refers to it is considered as requesting/assuming.



Goals:
> To model real world data in a more meaningful way. In real world meaning is in relation not state. (opinion)
> If done right, this library could be used to model a dictionary in a more elegant way. Or maybe some other use case.

Thoughts:
> Example: name is a property of something. name is also a thing by itself. name is a word. word is a property of name. word is also a recursive property.
> So property is just a node where it only considered a property is a give context.
> What would the smallest node look like?
    Smallest node shouldnt be related to anything and just store data.
    Example: 
        Node_Obj: Bill
            properties:
                Date and time
                Items count
                Total price
                Payment method/details

            Relations:
                To:
                    Items (Node_Obj list)
        
        Node_Obj: Item
            properties:
                name and/or description
                Category
> difference between a property and a node. property is just a format. node is information.
